# Nouislider::Rails

Currently tracking 6.0 of jquery-noUiSlider: http://refreshless.com/nouislider/. All credit and thanks to @leongersen for the awesome library.
Sorry for not naming it jquery-nouislider-rails, but someone else started another gem a few months ago here (https://github.com/soycamo/jquery-nouislider-rails).
